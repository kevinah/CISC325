# CISC325

For the final project, my group and I created a virtual reality program for Facebook.

The project had to perform seven tasks:
<ol> 
<li>Search and add a friend</li> 
<li>Post an update on your timeline</li> 
<li>Post a message on someone elses timeline</li> 
<li>Send a message to a friend</li> 
<li>Browse newsfeed</li> 
<li>Read a post by a friend</li> 
<li>React to posts by a friend</li>
</ol>

I have included a pdf explaining our program, and a demo video can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By4uPkUQ4VZ7YU8tUWczX0lMdDQ/view?usp=sharing
